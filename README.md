# Electron: Building Cross Platform Desktop Apps
This is the repository for my course Electron: Building Cross Platform Desktop Apps. The full course is available on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/electron-building-cross-platform-desktop-apps?trk=insiders_6787408_learning) and [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Electron-tutorials/Electron-Building-Cross-Platform-Desktop-Apps/518051-2.html)

Electron is an open-source framework for creating desktop applications with your favorite web technologies: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It makes it easy to create a simple app with a few lines of code, using languages you already know. Want to learn more? Join Ray Villalobos as he walks through the techniques you need to master cross-platform desktop development with Electron. Learn how to configure and communicate between app windows (aka webpages) via the main and renderer processes, and integrate the React and Bootstrap frameworks to build interfaces with multiple panels and custom menus. As a final step, Ray shows how to package your project into a standalone, clickable app that can be run on Windows, Mac, or Linux machines.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage. Or you can simply add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to peek at. 

## Branches
The branches are structured so that they correspond to the videos in the course. So, for example if I name a branch `02_03b` then that branch corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. The extra letter at the end of the name corresponds to the state of the branch. A `b` means that this is how the code looks at the beginning of the video, an `e` means that is how the code looked at the end of the video.

You may find additional branches that correspond to other states, so for example, you may see a `t`, which means this is a target branch. A target branch is something I use during development or updates of a course and it's for a branch that I'm working towards. For the purposes of taking a course, you may ignore any additional branches. The `master` branch usually has the state of the project as I'm working through it and the final state of the code when I finish the course.
